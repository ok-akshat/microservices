# Microservices

This hands-on is designed to provide you with practical experience in building, monitoring, testing, and scaling microservices. While theory will be minimal, foundational concepts will be covered to ensure a comprehensive understanding of microservices architecture and implementation.

## Section 1: Introduction to Microservices

In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of microservices architecture. You will learn:

- What are microservices?
- How to build simple microservices
- When to use microservices

## Section 2: Microservice Operations

This section focuses on the operational aspects of microservices, including:

- Monitoring
- Logging
- Testing
- Scaling

## Section 3: Microservice Patterns with Docker-compose

Here, we will implement different microservice patterns using Docker-compose, including:

- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Gateway

## Section 4: Microservice Tooling

We will explore various tools for setting up the microservice stack locally, covering:

- Development environments
- Containerization
- Orchestration

## Section 5: Building and Deploying Microservices

In the final section, we will delve into building services and deploying them using Node.js with Docker and Kubernetes (K8S) tooling.
